SAS software, down to its own programming language, is used by most large corporations for things like detecting credit card fraud for banks and fine-tuning pricing for retailers. But the data-analysis game is democratizing. New kinds of data are part of the trend, as Web and social-networking messages join all the information in corporate databases as grist of decision making. But so are new tools, opening data-analysis to a wider audience of corporate users, not just elite teams of Ph.D. quants in Fortune 500 companies.","abstract":"Bits blog notes the SAS Institute introduces SAS Visual Analytics data-analysis tool.
